This project implements a real-time drowsiness detection system that monitors the driver's eyes using a webcam and alerts them if signs of drowsiness are detected. It uses computer vision, eye aspect ratio (EAR), and optionally a CNN-based eye state classifier to identify prolonged eye closure â€” a strong sign of sleepiness.
