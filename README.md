# Multiple_PDFS
This project allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and ask questions across them using Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages LangChain, vector databases, and embedding models to understand, chunk, store, and retrieve relevant parts of the PDFs for generating context-aware answers.
